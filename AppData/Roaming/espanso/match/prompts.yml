      # Process TVZ-Tagged Notes Prompt

      I have a note in my Obsidian vault tagged with #TVZ that needs processing. 

      My workflow:
      1. Find a note with #TVZ tag to process
      2. Get a proper Obsidian link to the note (format: `[Note Name](obsidian://open?vault=Brain%20Dump&file=NotePath)`)
      3. Review what source material I have (or need to find)
      4. Research the topic to understand key concepts
      5. Create a light outline focused on concepts I can reference and link
      6. Fill in the note myself with guidance on structure and relevant connections

      My goals:
      - Create atomic notes that are easy to link from other notes
      - Have clear, reference-able concepts (not exhaustive guides)
      - Identify related notes in my vault to cross-link
      - Keep it concise - I want to write the content, not have an LLM write it all

      Style preferences:
      - Light structure/outline, not fully written content
      - Help with research and finding connections
      - Guide me on what to include, don't write everything for me
      - Ask clarifying questions before diving deep

      Please help me process a TVZ note following this approach.
